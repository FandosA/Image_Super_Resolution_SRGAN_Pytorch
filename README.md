# Image Super Resolution SRGAN
Unofficial implementation of the SRGAN model. With this repository you will be able to implement the model from scratch with your own dataset. The steps to train the model, as well as the details of the project, are explained below.

## Dataset preparation
To prepare the dataset, you first should put the images with which you will train the model into the folder ```dataset/```. I used the images from the [TartanAir dataset](https://theairlab.org/tartanair-dataset/).
